#Cattleships (24-Hour Group Hackathon)
##AngularJS and Firebase

The war between cats and cows has plagued this world for centuries and now we finally have a solution to end this dispute once and for all. Cattleships  is a multiplayer game using firebase which draws upon the rules of the classic guessing game Battleships. Opposing players each on their own devices, position their cows/cats on the game board and begin to take turns in order to locate and destroy hidden enemies.
